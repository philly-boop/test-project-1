## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
w3schools.com

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
Writing the logic for the guess function turned out to be a bit of a challenge for me. I overcame this challenge by following the flow chart with each level representing a layer of the nested if else statements.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I have always wondered how one is able to create websites like those for google, amazon, facebook, etc., where there can numerous pages linked to one another, the information of millions of users are saved and 
able to be retrieved by the users, and how money transactions work. In addition, with millions of users having their information saved in these websites and numerous transactions going across every day,how are
companies able to keep their customers information protected.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would create 3 levels(easy, medium, hard) that the player can select from. On the easy
level, it would be what have already, except the player will be allowed 3 mistakes. On the medium level, there will be 6 functional game buttons, increasing speed on playback after each turn, limited time for
the player to enter their guess, and the player will be allowed two mistakes. On the hard level, there will be 8 functional game buttons, even more increasing speed on playback after each turn, even less time
for the player to enter their guess, and the player will be allowed only one mistake.
